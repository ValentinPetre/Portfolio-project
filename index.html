         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hello! I'm Daniel Petre, I live in England and I'm originally from Romania. I'm currently working as an inventory controller for a medical company.
            Before I use to work as a warehouse worker and was at this time I decided to try and study coding and find a better job.</p>
         <p>I'm doing the Full-Stack Engineer course path from Codecademy as part of the Coding Traineeship provided by It Career Switch. 
            I Studied IT in highschool, so I wasn't a total stranger to coding going in to this. What makes it challenging is that I have a full-time job an a small kid, and is hard to find some quiet time.
         </p>
