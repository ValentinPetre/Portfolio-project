        <h2>Club Website</h2>
        <p>In this practice project, I have build a webpage for a completely made up gaming club. I have given it a made up name, choosing the page layout, styling and some images for the site.<br> 
           The aim of this project was for me to practice some of the responsive design tools I've learned. I have used percentages and relative units, such as 'rem', in my CSS to size and space page elements with 'width' and 'padding'. I've also made my website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen. I've practiced making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of 'width' after certain minimum size, and changing page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.<br>
           Also I have used Flexbox and experimented a bit with Grid, and with different styles such as : white text on black background, and round shaped images.

        <h2>Mysterious Organism</h2>
        <p>In this project I have practiced different javascript concepts.<br> 
           Using a factory function, I created objects that simulate multiple mysterious organisms all with different DNA comprised of 15 bases.
           This was done by using 2 functions to create different arrays representing DNA strands, each array with 15 string elements ('A','T','C', or 'G') representing DNA bases.<br>
           After this I created 3 functions using loops, conditional statements and some Math methods to work with the objects(organisms). One function using a while loop to change a random DNA base. 
           Another function making use of a nested for loop and an if statement to compare the DNA of 2 organisms and return the percentage of bases they have in common.
           The third function, created width a for loop and an if statement, was used determine if an organism is made up of at least 60% 'C' or 'G' bases.
           I used this function inside a while loop in order to create 30 instances of organisms with that type of DNA.

        <h2>Credit Card Checker</h2>
        <p>In here I've challenged myself to create 3 javascript functions that execute operations on arrays representing credit card numbers.<br>
           In the first function I've used a for loop with if/else conditional statements to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description">Luhn algorithm</a> in order to determine if credit card number is valid.<br>
           The second function has one parameter for a nested array of credit card numbers and checks for which numbers are ivalid. It does this by using the first function inside a for loop.<br>
           The third function takes as parameter a nested array of invalid numbers, and uses multiple if/else statements to match the numbers with the card companies. It then returns an array of companies.
